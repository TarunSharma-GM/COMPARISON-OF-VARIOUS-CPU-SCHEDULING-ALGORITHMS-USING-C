# COMPARISON-OF-VARIOUS-CPU-SCHEDULING-ALGORITHMS-USING-C

The purpose of this project was to test and compare the algorithms that establish the task of controlling multiple processes in the field of multiprogramming.

To design a C++ code to implement the CPU scheduling algorithm that are mostly used by the operating system and to provide a platform to compare and check which algorthim is the most efficient among the provided set of algothims.
